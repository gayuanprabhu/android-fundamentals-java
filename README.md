# Android Fundamentals – Java (Diploma Projects)

This repository documents a set of Android applications I built during my
Diploma in Computer Engineering (2022) while learning Android development
using **Java** and **XML**.

These projects focus on understanding core Android concepts such as
UI design, activity navigation, user input handling, and basic API usage.

## About the Projects

The applications in this repository were created as **practice and learning
projects** during my diploma studies.

Due to **system storage limitations**, some original source code was lost.
However, a few compiled applications and screenshots were preserved on
external storage (pendrive) and are documented here for reference.

This repository is intended to:
- Showcase hands-on Android learning
- Document project features and concepts
- Serve as a base for future rebuilds and improvements
